This code is the implementation of an idea I have been bouncing around
since March 2010.  I owe a fair amount of gratitude to the following
folks from PCC.com - while this code was written in its entirety while
self employed during a coffee drenched sprint from Feb 8th, 2011 to
Feb 10th, 2011, it was on their nickle that I had the inspiration and
developed the precursors to the deprecating sketch algorithm.  So here
goes:

To Tom Astle whose lunch time ruminations about his struggle to
educate people about the importance of good password security.  Tom
may you never have to explain to another user why "terces" is a bad
password.

To Bill Vandeventer for the encouragement and a little "20% time" to
do this research.

And to the rest of the folks at PCC.com for listening to me babble on
and on about password security issues.
